**Meet Alice, a 28-Year-Old Lawyer in NYC**

Goal: Respond quickly to client requests

Normally she has to: `(1) Open her browser, (2) go to her email, (3) look for client names, (4) find the template for an answer, (5) personalize it with client name and case details, (6) send.`

This can take `~5 mins`. And she does this task `15 times a day, 5 days a week.`

Enter Glu, she can ask AI to set up this workflow for her. AI will read her email and just confirm with her before sending the emails.

We estimate we can save her `~375 mins a week`, that’s `~25 hours a month.`

**Task 2: Organizing and Filing Legal Documents**

Alice often spends time: `(1) Opening documents from emails, (2) reading case numbers, (3) creating or selecting the correct folder, (4) renaming documents according to case and document type, (5) moving them to the designated folder, (6) closing documents.`

Each session takes about `~2 mins`. She performs this `4 times a day, 5 days a week.`

With Glu, Alice’s document management can be automated. The AI can sort and file documents based on case numbers and types.

This could save her `~40 mins a week`, adding up to `~2.6 hours a month.`

**Task 3: Monthly Invoice Generation**

Alice's routine includes: `(1) Opening accounting software, (2) selecting clients, (3) inputting billable hours and expenses, (4) generating invoice previews, (5) confirming details, (6) sending invoices via email.`

Typically, it takes `~12 mins` per invoice. She does this `2 times a week.`

Glu can automate invoice generation. Alice needs to provide basic info, and Glu handles the rest.

She might save about `~48 mins a week`, which means `~3.2 hours a month.`

**Meet Bob, a 24-Year-Old Startup Founder**

Goal: Efficiently Sync Meeting Notes with Team Calendar

Bob's routine involves: `(1) Opening meeting notes, (2) highlighting key points, (3) opening the team calendar, (4) creating new events, (5) pasting notes, (6) setting reminders, (7) saving events.`

This process takes `~2 mins`. He does it `5 times a week.`

With Glu, Bob can streamline this. The AI syncs meeting notes directly to the calendar.

He could save `~10 mins a week`, leading to `~40 mins a month.`

**Task 2: Daily Code Backup and Sync**

Bob’s daily tasks include: `(1) Opening the code repository, (2) selecting recent changes, (3) choosing a cloud storage destination, (4) initiating backup, (5) monitoring progress, (6) verifying completion.`

Each backup takes `~3 mins`. Done daily, that's `30 times a month.`

Glu can automate this, ensuring Bob's code is backed up without his manual intervention.

This could save him `~90 mins a month.`

**Task 3: Tracking User Engagement Metrics**

Bob needs to: `(1) Access analytics tools, (2) extract relevant data, (3) compile data in spreadsheets, (4) create visual reports, (5) email reports to the team.`

The task takes `~30 mins`. He does it `once a week.`

Glu can automate data extraction and report generation, sending it directly to his team.
